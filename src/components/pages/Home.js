        Born and raised in Istanbul, living in New York.  A lifetime of travel has solidified my ambition to meet daring goals and given me flexibility in dealing with what life throws my way. As a former marketing specialist I learned to understand customerâ€™s perspective, how to be resourceful and solve problems. I am at my happiest when I am merging my technological and creative skills to create beautiful, thoughtful websites. From building full-stack applications to researching new and emerging tech, I use my love of coding to build value for any company I work with.
